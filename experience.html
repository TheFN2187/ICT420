                        The main responsibilities of an Advanced Repair Agent are to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with
                        client devices such as laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. It was also their responsibility to
                        perform upgrades and repairs on laptops, desktops, and Apple iPhones. Due to this, every Advanced
                        Repair Agent at Geek Squad is also an Apple authorized service technician certified directly through
                        Apple.

                        Authorized Service Providers are required to use Apple Certified Technicians when repairing Apple
                        products.<br><br>
                        Becoming certified to repair Apple products requires passing exams through an online Authorized

                        Devices I am certified to repair on include all currently supported iPhones from iPhone 8 and later. 
                        I am also certified to troubleshoot iOS, iPadOS, macOS devices, and their accessories (AirPods, AirTags, etc.)
                         for operating system or software issues.
