                        The main responsibilities of an Advanced Repair Agent are to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with
                        client devices such as laptops, desktops, phones, and tablets. It was also their responsibility to
                        perform upgrades and repairs on laptops, desktops, and Apple iPhones. Due to this, every Advanced
                        Repair Agent at Geek Squad is also an Apple authorized service technician certified directly through
                        Apple.
